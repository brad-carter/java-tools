// Loop Iteration Explainer
// Arrays are indexed groupings of the same variable which start at 0. 
// In order to search through an array, whether that be for insertion, deletion, changing, or moving array elements, loops are commonly used
// Here are a few examples of loops for multiple types and their implementations.




//  Looping over int arrays for a singular instance of a specific item
// START-OF 
      int[] x = new int[5];
      int y = 4; // 4 is an example value that we are searching for.
      x[3] = 4; // here, we set x[3] (the element at index 3, or the 4th item in x, to 4)
      
      // it is important to note that an array's FIRST ITEM WILL BE AT INDEX 0
      
      // replace x.length with yourArray.length
    for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++ ){
        if (x[i] == y){
            System.out.print(i);
            break; // this will print the array index where x[i] == y. This loop will cease to iterate.
        }
    }
    
// END-OF
